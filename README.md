Dear reader, your digital life is fragmented and controlled by corporations, leaving you vulnerable and powerless. It does not have to be that way. Until now, you faced two forks in the road:

1. **Familiar Corporate Highway**: Corporations own all your data. Some of your sensitive data may be lost. Praise our corporate overlords and hope for the best.

2. **The Rocky Trail**: Venture down the rocky trail of actively collecting and storing as much of your personal digital information as possible. This path requires downloading and backing up data from all services and platforms you use, demanding a tremendous amount of time, effort, and technical skills to navigate.

Mycelium offers a third path. A user-friendly, open-source, privacy-focused decentralized network where you can store, stream, search, and share data securely, while maintaining full control and ownership.

This isn't just about privacy or security. It's about freedom. The freedom to express yourself without fear of censorship. The freedom to preserve your digital legacy on your own terms. The freedom to shape your online narrative without interference from algorithms or corporate policies.

Digital sovereignty is a declaration of independence. It's your digital life. Period.

## History of Decentralized Social Networks

Email and FidoNet have existed since the 1980s. Mastodon showed us that we can have Twitter-like functionality without ceding control to a single company, and the EU officially uses it (hooray!)

Mycelium grows on this legacy. But it can feel isolating to use Mastodon when you are the only person in your friend group who is geeky enough to use it. Mycelium is useful to you from day one, and you will benefit tremendously from it without any social features, but the social part makes it even more powerful when the people close to you are using it too.
