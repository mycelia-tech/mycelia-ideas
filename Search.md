There are two types of search: one for public data about the world, and another for private information related to you, the people in your life, your personal projects, and your work. 

Good search for public data is a highly contested field and will continue to improve. However, private search remains a challenge. To effectively search your personal data, you must trust a provider enough to allow them to see the entirety of your information. The alternative is to become a neo-luddite, which puts you at a significant disadvantage whenever you need to recall or compile something based on your existing private data.

While you can manually search and organize your personal information, computers are radically better at this task than humans will ever be, and this gap is only growing.
