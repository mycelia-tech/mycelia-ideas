## Distribution and Design
Shrooms are distributed as `.shroom` files, making it incredibly easy to manage and install.

Technically `.shroom` files are just `.zip` archives with a pre-defined structure

Some ideas:
   - Maintain an official marketplace as the primary hub, support alternative marketplaces
   - Implement digital signatures for all shrooms.
   - Ecosystem for independent audits for builds.
   - User ratings and reviews.
   - Work on great development tools, foster active developer community. Easy to use API.
   - An intuitive UI for browsing, installing, and managing extensions.
   - Support automatic updates.
   - A way to securely track usage statistics without using the internet from within the extension.
   - Logs are saved in the Mycelium itself.
   - Sandboxing, no internet connection unless 100% necessary.
   - Use tools like LLMs as system calls, abstract it away, don't let the shrooms call the APIs directly except when absolutely necessary
   - Get inspiration from Obsidian, Raycast, Home Assistant, Blender, etc...
